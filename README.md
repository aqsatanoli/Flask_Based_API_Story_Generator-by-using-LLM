# Flask_Based_API_Story_Generator-by-using-LLM
This project allows users to input any topic, and the system generates a creative script or story based on the given input. The backend is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated through an API, providing dynamic content generation. The API is tested using Postman to ensure reliability and performance.
